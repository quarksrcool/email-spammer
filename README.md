# email-spammer

Overview:

some python code to spam an email address. I am using the google smtp server, so you have to spam from a google email address, but feel free to replace that with your own.

This was made with smtplib and optparse libraries in python2.7

Screw learning the slightly diffrent python3 syntax, that requires some sort of effort.

Instructions:

-e, --email : the email address you want to spam from

-t, --to : the email you want to spam #I do not not not endorse you spamming the fbi with this, but I mean its not my problem

-p, --password: the password to your email address #I swear to god if your password is password123

-u, --username: the username for the --emailaddress argument

-m, message: the message you want to spam them with, has to be short enough to fit into a terminal window or your gonna have a bad time. # might add a functionality where you can use a txt file later on if I ever get to it.

Etc non essential stuff:

Dont take any of what I do here seriously, you would have to be retarded to do that.

To avoid any friendly knocks on the door, from my friends in blue, here is an official disclaimer:

Dont do anything illegal, which in this case doesnt mean breaking the law, it just means dont piss of the wrong person with this. Ex. don't do this to the police, but hey if you use a vpn and make a burner gmail account..... just a thought.'

alright go have fun kids.
